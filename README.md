PyPy로 인터프리터 작성하기
==========================
이 글은 Andrew Brown <brownan@gmail.com>에 의해 작성되었으며,
pypy-dev 메일링 리스트에 있는 개발자들의 도움을 받았습니다.

이 튜토리얼의 원본과 주변 파일들은
https://bitbucket.org/brownan/pypy-tutorial/ 에서 구할 수 있습니다.

제가 처음 PyPy 프로젝트를 알게 되었을 때는 이게 대체 무엇인지 깨닫는데 시간이 꽤
걸렸습니다. 저와 같은 사람들을 위해 설명하자면 PyPy는 다음의 두 부분으로 요약할
수 있습니다:

 * 인터프리터 구현을 위한 도구의 집합
 * 그 것을 사용하여 만들어진 파이썬 구현체

두번째 부분은 아마 대부분의 사람들이 생각하는 PyPy일 것입니다.
하지만 이 튜토리얼에서는 그 파이썬 인터프리터에 대해서는 다루지 *않습니다*.
이 튜토리얼은 자신의 언어를 위한 인터프리터를 직접 구현하는 법에 대한
내용입니다.

이는 저 스스로 PyPy가 정확히 무엇인지, 어떻게 동작하는지를 이해하기 위해 진행한
프로젝트이기도 합니다.

이 튜토리얼은 독자가 PyPy를, 그것이 어떻게 돌아가는지를, 심지어 그게 무엇인지를
잘 모를 수 있을 것이라 가정합니다. 저는 처음부터 차근차근 설명할 요량입니다.

PyPy는 무엇을 하는가
--------------------
PyPy가 무엇을 할 수 있는지 대략적인 개요를 설명하겠습니다. 일단 여러분이
인터프리터를 하나 만들고 싶다고 칩시다.
이는 소스코드 파서와, 바이트코드 해석 루프, 그 외에 잡다한 표준 라이브러리
코드를 포함합니다.

적당히 복잡한 언어라면 작업량이 꽤나 되겠죠. 그리고 상당한 로우레벨 작업이
수반됩니다. 파서와 컴파일러 코드를 작업하는건 대체로 재미가 없습니다. 그리고
그 것이 바로 파서와 컴파일러를 생성하는 도구의 존재이유입니다.

그럼에도 인터프리터를 구현하려면 메모리 관리를 고려해야 하고, 임의의 정밀도를
가진 정수나 멋지게 일반화된 해시테이블 등등을 원한다면 바퀴를 다시 만드는 노력이
필요합니다.
이는 누군가 언어를 하나 만들고 싶다는 생각을 무르게 만드는데 충분한 요소입니다.

파이썬같이, 이미 존재하는 고수준 언어를 사용해서 자신의 언어를 작성할 수 있다면
멋지겠죠? 자동화된 메모리 관리나 풍부한 자료구조들을 그대로 가져다 사용할 수
있는 이상적인 환경일 것입니다.
어, 근데 인터프리터 위에서 돌아가는 인터프리터라면 느리지 않을까요?
그렇게 만들어버린다면 인터프리팅이 두 번에 걸쳐서 처리될 것입니다.

눈치 채셨겠지만 PyPy는 이 문제를 해결합니다. PyPy는 여러분의 인터프리터 코드를
분석 및 C 코드(또는 JVM이나 CLI)로 변환하기 위한 정교한 툴체인입니다.
이 것은 "번역(translation)"을 수행하기 위해, 어떻게 많은 파이썬 문법과
표준 라이브러리들을 옮겨낼지를 알고 있습니다. 여러분이 작업해야할 것은 여러분의
인터프리터를 파이썬의 서브셋인 **RPython**으로 작성하는 것 뿐입니다.
RPython은 분석과 번역 작업 및 매우 효율적인 인터프리터를 생성할 수 있도록
매우 조심스럽게 정의된 언어입니다.

왜냐하면 효율적인 인터프리터는 쉽게 작성할 수 있어야 하기 때문입니다.

언어
----
구현하기에 굉장히 쉬운 언어를 하나 골랐습니다. 런타임은 모두 `0`으로 초기화된
정수 테이프와, 테이프 중 한 칸을 가르키는 포인터 하나로 구성되어있는 언어입니다.
이 언어는 8가지 명령어로 구성되어있습니다:

### >
테이프 포인터를 오른쪽으로 한 칸 이동시킵니다.

### <
테이프 포인터를 왼쪽으로 한 칸 이동시킵니다.

### +
포인터가 가르키는 칸의 값을 증가시킵니다.

### -
포인터가 가르키는 칸의 값을 감소시킵니다.

### [
만약 포인터가 가르키는 칸의 값이 `0`이라면 상응하는 괄호짝 `]` 뒤로 건너뜁니다.

### ]
상응하는 괄호짝 `[`로 돌아갑니다 (반복 조건도 평가합니다).

### .
포인터가 가르키는 칸의 값을 `stdout`으로 한 바이트 출력합니다.

### ,
`stdin`에서 한 바이트 읽어와 포인터가 가르키는 칸에 대입합니다.

인식되지 않는 바이트들은 무시합니다.

이게 무엇인지 아는 분들이 있으시겠죠. 전 앞으로 이 것을 BF라고 부르겠습니다.

한가지 주목할 점은 이 언어는 바이트코드가 바로 언어 자신이라는 점입니다;
달리 소스코드를 바이트코드로 변환할 필요가 없습니다.
따라서 이 언어는 읽는 즉시 해석할 수 있습니다:
우리 인터프리터의 메인 평가 루프는 소스코드에 작성된 그대로 돌아갈 겁니다.
이는 구현을 굉장히 단순하게 만들어줍니다.

First Steps
===========
Let's start out by writing a BF interpreter in plain old Python. The first step
is sketching out an eval loop::

    def mainloop(program):
        tape = Tape()
        pc = 0
        while pc < len(program):
            code = program[pc]

            if code == ">":
                tape.advance()
            elif code == "<":
                tape.devance()
            elif code == "+":
                tape.inc()
            elif code == "-":
                tape.dec()
            elif code == ".":
                sys.stdout.write(chr(tape.get()))
            elif code == ",":
                tape.set(ord(sys.stdin.read(1)))
            elif code == "[" and value() == 0:
                # Skip forward to the matching ]
            elif code == "]" and value() != 0:
                # Skip back to the matching [

            pc += 1
        
As you can see, a program counter (pc) holds the current instruction index. The
first statement in the loop gets the instruction to execute, and then a
compound if statement decides how to execute that instruction.

The implementation of [ and ] are left out here, but they should change the
program counter to the value of the matching bracket. (The pc then gets
incremented, so the condition is evaluated once when entering a loop, and once
at the end of each iteration)
        
Here's the implementation of the Tape class, which holds the tape's values as
well as the tape pointer::

    class Tape(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.thetape = [0]
            self.position = 0

        def get(self):
            return self.thetape[self.position]
        def set(self, val):
            self.thetape[self.position] = val
        def inc(self):
            self.thetape[self.position] += 1
        def dec(self):
            self.thetape[self.position] -= 1
        def advance(self):
            self.position += 1
            if len(self.thetape) <= self.position:
                self.thetape.append(0)
        def devance(self):
            self.position -= 1
            
As you can see, the tape expands as needed to the right, indefinitely. We
should really add some error checking to make sure the pointer doesn't go
negative, but I'm not worrying about that now.
            
Except for the omission of the "[" and "]" implementation, this code will work
fine.  However, if the program has a lot of comments, it will have to skip over
them one byte at a time at runtime. So let's parse those out once and for all.

At the same time, we'll build a dictionary mapping between brackets, so that
finding a matching bracket is just a single dictionary lookup. Here's how::

    def parse(program):
        parsed = []
        bracket_map = {}
        leftstack = []

        pc = 0
        for char in program:
            if char in ('[', ']', '<', '>', '+', '-', ',', '.'):
                parsed.append(char)

                if char == '[':
                    leftstack.append(pc)
                elif char == ']':
                    left = leftstack.pop()
                    right = pc
                    bracket_map[left] = right
                    bracket_map[right] = left
                pc += 1
        
        return "".join(parsed), bracket_map

This returns a string with all invalid instructions removed, and a dictionary
mapping bracket indexes to their matching bracket index.

All we need is some glue code and we have a working BF interpreter::

    def run(input):
        program, map = parse(input.read())
        mainloop(program, map)
        
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        run(open(sys.argv[1], 'r'))
        
If you're following along at home, you'll also need to change the signature of
mainloop() and implement the bracket branches of the if statement. Here's the
complete example: `<example1.py>`_

At this point you can try it out to see that it works by running the
interpreter under python, but be warned, it will be *very* slow on the more
complex examples::

    $ python example1.py 99bottles.b
    
You can find mandel.b and several other example programs (not written by me) in
my repository.
        
PyPy Translation
================
But this is not about writing a BF interpreter, this is about PyPy. So what
does it take to get PyPy to translate this into a super-fast executable?

As a side note, there are some simple examples in the pypy/translator/goal
directory of the PyPy source tree that are helpful here. My starting point for
learning this was the example "targetnopstandalone.py", a simple hello world
for PyPy.

For our example, the module must define a name called "target" which returns the
entry point. The translation process imports your module and looks for that
name, calls it, and the function object returned is where it starts the
translation.

::

    def run(fp):
        program_contents = ""
        while True:
            read = os.read(fp, 4096)
            if len(read) == 0:
                break
            program_contents += read
        os.close(fp)
        program, bm = parse(program_contents)
        mainloop(program, bm)

    def entry_point(argv):
        try:
            filename = argv[1]
        except IndexError:
            print "You must supply a filename"
            return 1
        
        run(os.open(filename, os.O_RDONLY, 0777))
        return 0

    def target(*args):
        return entry_point, None
        
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        entry_point(sys.argv)
        
The entry_point function is passed the command line arguments when you run the
resulting executable.

A few other things have changed here too. See the next section...

About RPython
=============
Let's talk a bit about RPython at this point. PyPy can't translate arbitrary
Python code because Python is a bit too dynamic. There are restrictions on what
standard library functions and what syntax constructs one can use. I won't be
going over all the restrictions, but for more information see
http://readthedocs.org/docs/pypy/en/latest/coding-guide.html#restricted-python

In the example above, you'll see a few things have changed.  I'm now using low
level file descriptors with os.open and os.read instead of file objects.
The implementation of "." and "," are similarly tweaked (not shown above).
Those are the only changes to make to this code, the rest is simple enough for
PyPy to digest.

That wasn't so hard, was it? I still get to use dictionaries, expandable lists,
and even classes and objects! And if low level file descriptors are too low for
you, there are some helpful abstractions in the rlib.streamio module included
with PyPy's "RPython standard library."

For the example thus far, see `<example2.py>`_

Translating
===========
If you haven't already, check yourself out the latest version of PyPy from
their bitbucket.org repository::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
    
(A recent revision is necessary because of a bugfix that makes my example
possible)

The script to run is in "pypy/translator/goal/translate.py". Run this script,
passing in our example module as an argument.

::

    $ python ./pypy/rpython/bin/rpython example2.py
    
(You can use PyPy's python interpreter for extra speed, but it's not necessary)

PyPy will churn for a bit, drawing some nice looking fractals to your console
while it works. It takes around 20 seconds on my machine.

The result from this is an executable binary that interprets BF programs.
Included in my repository are some example BF programs, including a mandelbrot
fractal generator, which takes about 45 seconds to run on my computer. Try it
out::

    $ ./example2-c mandel.b

Compare this to running the interpreter un-translated on top of python::

    $ python example2.py mandel.b
    
Takes forever, doesn't it?

So there you have it. We've successfully written our own interpreter in RPython
and translated it with the PyPy toolchain.

Adding JIT
==========
Translating RPython to C is pretty cool, but one of the best features of PyPy
is its ability to *generate just-in-time compilers for your interpreter*.
That's right, from just a couple hints on how your interpreter is structured,
PyPy will generate and include a JIT compiler that will, at runtime, translate
the interpreted code of our BF language to machine code!

So what do we need to tell PyPy to make this happen? First it needs to know
where the start of your bytecode evaluation loop is. This lets it keep track of
instructions being executed in the target language (BF).

We also need to let it know what defines a particular execution frame. Since
our language doesn't really have stack frames, this boils down to what's
constant for the execution of a particular instruction, and what's not. These
are called "green" and "red" variables, respectively.

Refer back to `<example2.py>`_ for the following.

In our main loop, there are four variables used: pc, program, bracket_map, and
tape. Of those, pc, program, and bracket_map are all green variables. They
*define* the execution of a particular instruction. If the JIT routines see the
same combination of green variables as before, it knows it's skipped back and
must be executing a loop.  The variable "tape" is our red variable, it's what's
being manipulated by the execution.

So let's tell PyPy this info. Start by importing the JitDriver class and making
an instance::

    from rpython.rlib.jit import JitDriver
    jitdriver = JitDriver(greens=['pc', 'program', 'bracket_map'],
            reds=['tape'])
    
And we add this line to the very top of the while loop in the mainloop
function::

        jitdriver.jit_merge_point(pc=pc, tape=tape, program=program,
                bracket_map=bracket_map)
                
We also need to define a JitPolicy. We're not doing anything fancy, so this is
all we need somewhere in the file::

    def jitpolicy(driver):
        from rpython.jit.codewriter.policy import JitPolicy
        return JitPolicy()
        
See this example at `<example3.py>`_
        
Now try translating again, but with the flag ``--opt=jit``::

    $ python ./pypy/rpython/bin/rpython --opt=jit example3.py

It will take significantly longer to translate with JIT enabled, almost 8
minutes on my machine, and the resulting binary will be much larger. When it's
done, try having it run the mandelbrot program again. A world of difference,
from 12 seconds compared to 45 seconds before!

Interestingly enough, you can see when the JIT compiler switches from
interpreted to machine code with the mandelbrot example. The first few lines of
output come out pretty fast, and then the program gets a boost of speed and
gets even faster.

A bit about Tracing JIT Compilers
=================================
It's worth it at this point to read up on how tracing JIT compilers work.
Here's a brief explanation: The interpreter is usually running your interpreter
code as written. When it detects a loop of code in the target language (BF) is
executed often, that loop is considered "hot" and marked to be traced. The next
time that loop is entered, the interpreter gets put in tracing mode where every
executed instruction is logged.

When the loop is finished, tracing stops. The trace of the loop is sent to an
optimizer, and then to an assembler which outputs machine code. That machine
code is then used for subsequent loop iterations.

This machine code is often optimized for the most common case, and depends on
several assumptions about the code. Therefore, the machine code will contain
guards, to validate those assumptions. If a guard check fails, the runtime
falls back to regular interpreted mode.

A good place to start for more information is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation

Debugging and Trace Logs
========================
Can we do any better? How can we see what the JIT is doing? Let's do two
things.

First, let's add a get_printable_location function, which is used during debug
trace logging::

    def get_location(pc, program, bracket_map):
        return "%s_%s_%s" % (
                program[:pc], program[pc], program[pc+1:]
                )
    jitdriver = JitDriver(greens=['pc', 'program', 'bracket_map'], reds=['tape'],
            get_printable_location=get_location)
            
This function is passed in the green variables, and should return a string.
Here, we're printing out the BF code, surrounding the currently executing
instruction with underscores so we can see where it is.

Download this as `<example4.py>`_ and translate it the same as example3.py.

Now let's run a test program (test.b, which just prints the letter "A" 15 or so
times in a loop) with trace logging::

    $ PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt:logfile ./example4-c test.b
    
Now take a look at the file "logfile". This file is quite hard to read, so
here's my best shot at explaining it.

The file contains a log of every trace that was performed, and is essentially a
glimpse at what instructions it's compiling to machine code for you. It's
useful to see if there are unnecessary instructions or room for optimization.

Each trace starts with a line that looks like this::

    [3c091099e7a4a7] {jit-log-opt-loop
    
and ends with a line like this::

    [3c091099eae17d jit-log-opt-loop}
    
The next line tells you which loop number it is, and how many ops are in it.
In my case, the first trace looks like this::


    1  [3c167c92b9118f] {jit-log-opt-loop
    2  # Loop 0 : loop with 26 ops
    3  [p0, p1, i2, i3]
    4  debug_merge_point('+<[>[_>_+<-]>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    5  debug_merge_point('+<[>[>_+_<-]>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    6  i4 = getarrayitem_gc(p1, i2, descr=<SignedArrayDescr>)
    7  i6 = int_add(i4, 1)
    8  setarrayitem_gc(p1, i2, i6, descr=<SignedArrayDescr>)
    9  debug_merge_point('+<[>[>+_<_-]>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    10 debug_merge_point('+<[>[>+<_-_]>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    11 i7 = getarrayitem_gc(p1, i3, descr=<SignedArrayDescr>)
    12 i9 = int_sub(i7, 1)
    13 setarrayitem_gc(p1, i3, i9, descr=<SignedArrayDescr>)
    14 debug_merge_point('+<[>[>+<-_]_>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    15 i10 = int_is_true(i9)
    16 guard_true(i10, descr=<Guard2>) [p0]
    17 i14 = call(ConstClass(ll_dict_lookup__dicttablePtr_Signed_Signed), ConstPtr(ptr12), 90, 90, descr=<SignedCallDescr>)
    18 guard_no_exception(, descr=<Guard3>) [i14, p0]
    19 i16 = int_and(i14, -9223372036854775808)
    20 i17 = int_is_true(i16)
    21 guard_false(i17, descr=<Guard4>) [i14, p0]
    22 i19 = call(ConstClass(ll_get_value__dicttablePtr_Signed), ConstPtr(ptr12), i14, descr=<SignedCallDescr>)
    23 guard_no_exception(, descr=<Guard5>) [i19, p0]
    24 i21 = int_add(i19, 1)
    25 i23 = int_lt(i21, 114)
    26 guard_true(i23, descr=<Guard6>) [i21, p0]
    27 guard_value(i21, 86, descr=<Guard7>) [i21, p0]
    28 debug_merge_point('+<[>[_>_+<-]>.[<+>-]<<-]++++++++++.', 0)
    29 jump(p0, p1, i2, i3, descr=<Loop0>)
    30 [3c167c92bc6a15] jit-log-opt-loop}

I've trimmed the debug_merge_point lines a bit, they were really long.

So let's see what this does. This trace takes 4 parameters: 2 object pointers
(p0 and p1) and 2 integers (i2 and i3). Looking at the debug lines, it seems to
be tracing one iteration of this loop: "[>+<-]"

It starts executing the first operation on line 4, a ">", but immediately
starts executing the next operation. The ">" had no instructions, and looks
like it was optimized out completely.  This loop must always act on the same
part of the tape, the tape pointer is constant for this trace. An explicit
advance operation is unnecessary.

Lines 5 to 8 are the instructions for the "+" operation. First it gets the
array item from the array in pointer p1 at index i2 (line 6), adds 1 to it and
stores it in i6 (line 7), and stores it back in the array (line 8).

Line 9 starts the "<" instruction, but it is another no-op. It seems that i2
and i3 passed into this routine are the two tape pointers used in this loop
already calculated. Also deduced is that p1 is the tape array. It's not clear
what p0 is.

Lines 10 through 13 perform the "-" operation: get the array value (line 11),
subtract (line 12) and set the array value (line 13).

Next, on line 14, we come to the "]" operation. Lines 15 and 16 check whether
i9 is true (non-zero). Looking up, i9 is the array value that we just
decremented and stored, now being checked as the loop condition, as expected
(remember the definition of "]").  Line 16 is a guard, if the condition is not
met, execution jumps somewhere else, in this case to the routine called
<Guard2> and is passed one parameter: p0.

Assuming we pass the guard, lines 17 through 23 are doing the dictionary lookup
to bracket_map to find where the program counter should jump to.  I'm not too
familiar with what the instructions are actually doing, but it looks like there
are two external calls and 3 guards. This seems quite expensive, especially
since we know bracket_map will never change (PyPy doesn't know that).  We'll
see below how to optimize this.

Line 24 increments the newly acquired instruction pointer. Lines 25 and 26 make
sure it's less than the program's length.

Additionally, line 27 guards that i21, the incremented instruction pointer, is
exactly 86. This is because it's about to jump to the beginning (line 29) and
the instruction pointer being 86 is a precondition to this block.

Finally, the loop closes up at line 28 so the JIT can jump to loop body <Loop0>
to handle that case (line 29), which is the beginning of the loop again. It
passes in parameters (p0, p1, i2, i3).

Optimizing
==========
As mentioned, every loop iteration does a dictionary lookup to find the
corresponding matching bracket for the final jump. This is terribly
inefficient, the jump target is not going to change from one loop to the next.
This information is constant and should be compiled in as such.

The problem is that the lookups are coming from a dictionary, and PyPy is
treating it as opaque. It doesn't know the dictionary isn't being modified or
isn't going to return something different on each query.

What we need to do is provide another hint to the translation to say that the
dictionary query is a pure function, that is, its output depends *only* on its
inputs and the same inputs should always return the same output.

To do this, we use a provided function decorator rpython.rlib.jit.purefunction,
and wrap the dictionary call in a decorated function::

    @purefunction
    def get_matching_bracket(bracket_map, pc):
        return bracket_map[pc]
        
This version can be found at `<example5.py>`_

Translate again with the JIT option and observe the speedup. Mandelbrot now
only takes 6 seconds!  (from 12 seconds before this optimization)

Let's take a look at the trace from the same function::

    [3c29fad7b792b0] {jit-log-opt-loop

Much better! Each loop iteration is an add, a subtract, two array loads, two
array stores, and a guard on the exit condition. That's it! This code doesn't
require *any* program counter manipulation.

I'm no expert on optimizations, this tip was suggested by Armin Rigo on the
pypy-dev list. Carl Friedrich has a series of posts on how to optimize your
interpreter that are also very useful: http://bit.ly/bundles/cfbolz/1

Final Words
===========
I hope this has shown some of you what PyPy is all about other than a faster
implementation of Python.

For those that would like to know more about how the process works, there are
several academic papers explaining the process in detail that I recommend. In
particular: Tracing the Meta-Level: PyPy's Tracing JIT Compiler.
